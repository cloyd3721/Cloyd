  <h2>English</h2>
  <p>English is a West Germanic language first spoken in early medieval England, which has eventually become the leading language of international discourse in the 21st century.
    It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia,
    a peninsula on the Baltic Sea. English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages,
    particularly Old Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.
English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English.
Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England;
this was a period in which English was influenced by Old French, in particular through its Old Norman dialect.
Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.</p>
